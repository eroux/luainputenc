luainputenc is the adaptation of inputenc for LuaTeX, as the old inputenc does
not work (at all) with the LuaTeX engine.

You need luatextra to use this package.

Please note that you have to use this package even if you compile documents in
UTF-8.

This package automatically calls the old inputenc if called with pdfTeX, and
xetex-inputenc if called with XeTeX, so you can safely use it with all your
documents.

The different files are:

luainputenc.sty:   the LaTeX package
luainputenc.lua:   contains the lua functions for encoding translation
lutf8.def:         the replacement for utf8.def
lutf8x.def:        idem, with new functionalities for unicode fonts
eu2enc.def:        definition of the EU2 (unicode) font encoding for LuaTeX
eu2lmr.fd:         definition of the lmodern font for the EU2 encoding
inputenc.sty.diff: patch for inputenc.sty to load luainputenc automatically if
                   called with LuaTeX
                   
Please see the luatextra-reference.pdf documentation for more details.
